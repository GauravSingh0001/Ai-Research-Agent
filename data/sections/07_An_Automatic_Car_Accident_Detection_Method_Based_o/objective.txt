In this paper, we proposed an automatic car accident detection method based on Cooperative Vehicle Infrastructure Systems (CVIS) and machine vision. First of all, a novel image dataset CAD-CVIS is established to improve accuracy of accident detection based on intelligent roadside devices in CVIS. Finally, our experiment study evaluates performance of YOLO-CA for detecting car accidents, and the results show that our proposed method can detect car accident in 0.0461 seconds (21.6FPS) with 90.02% average precision (AP).
