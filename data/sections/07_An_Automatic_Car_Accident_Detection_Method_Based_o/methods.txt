Especially, CAD-CVIS is consisted of various kinds of accident types, weather conditions and accident location, which can improve self-adaptability of accident detection methods among different traffic situations. Secondly, we develop a deep neural network model YOLO-CA based on CAD-CVIS and deep learning algorithms to detect accident. In the model, we utilize Multi-Scale Feature Fusion (MSFF) and loss function with dynamic weights to enhance performance of detecting small objects. In additionally, we compare YOLO-CA with other object detection models, and the results demonstrate the comprehensive performance improvement on the accuracy and real-time over other models.
