• In this research, we conducted a benchmark study to assess the performance of different applicable machine learning approaches on three different datasets where we accumulated the largest and most diversified one.

• We explored a number of advanced pre-trained language models for fake news detection along with the traditional and deep learning ones and compared their performances from different aspects for the first time to the best of our knowledge.

• Hence, these models are significantly better option for languages with limited electronic contents, i.e., training data.

• We also carried out several analysis based on the models' performance, article's topic, article's length, and discussed different lessons learned from them.

• We believe that this benchmark study will help the research community to explore further and news sites/blogs to select the most appropriate fake news detection method.
