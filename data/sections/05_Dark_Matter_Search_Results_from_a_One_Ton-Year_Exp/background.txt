The energy region of interest, [1.4,10.6]  keV_{ee} ([4.9,40.9] keV_{nr}), exhibits an ultralow electron recoil background rate of [82_{-3}^{+5}(syst)±3(stat)]  events/(ton yr keV_{ee}). No significant excess over background is found, and a profile likelihood analysis parametrized in spatial and energy dimensions excludes new parameter space for the WIMP-nucleon spin-independent elastic scatter cross section for WIMP masses above 6  GeV/c^{2}, with a minimum of 4.1×10^{-47}  cm^{2} at 30  GeV/c^{2} and a 90% confidence level.
