There will be sensors for health monitoring system that will track the driver's health, such as heart rate, temperature, and whether or not the driver is drunk, as well as drowsiness. This prototype uses an ultrasonic sensor, which will detect very close vehicles and reduce its own speed. However, the engine will start based on driver health, where sensors will always observe the driver's lively movement. Car accident prevention with the health monitoring system of the driver can be a blueprint to reduce car accidents, and it will be cost-effective.
