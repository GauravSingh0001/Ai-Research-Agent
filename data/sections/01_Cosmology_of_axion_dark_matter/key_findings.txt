• I present an introduction and topical review on axions as a dark matter candidate.

• Emphasis is placed on issues surrounding the cosmology of axion dark matter that are relevant for present-day searches, including: early-Universe production mechanisms, predictions of the axion mass, bounds on axion properties derived from cosmological data, as well as the direct and indirect detection of relic axion populations.
