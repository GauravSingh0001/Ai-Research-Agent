To address these problems, we propose k-nearest neighbor, classification and regression trees, and random forests as learning algorithms for regression to build optimal predictive models. In addition, we reveal the importance ranking of legal factors by permutation feature importance. The experimental results show that the random forest model outperformed the other models and achieved good performance, and “the mental suffering damages that plaintiff claims” and “the age of the victim” play important roles in assessments of mental suffering damages in fatal car accident cases in Taiwan. Therefore, litigants and their lawyers can predict the discretionary damages of mental suffering in advance and wisely decide whether they should litigate or not, and then they can focus on the crucial legal factors and develop the best litigation strategy.
