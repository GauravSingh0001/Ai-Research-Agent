We report the first dark matter search results using the commissioning data from PandaX-4T. Using a time projection chamber with 3.7 tonne of liquid xenon target and an exposure of 0.63  tonne·year, 1058 candidate events are identified within an approximate nuclear recoil energy window between 5 and 100 keV.
