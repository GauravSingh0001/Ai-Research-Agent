• We present a broadly accessible overview of the development life cycle of clinical AI models that is general enough to be adapted to most machine learning projects, and then give an in-depth case study of the development process of a deep learning based system to detect aortic aneurysms in Computed Tomography (CT) exams.

• We hope other healthcare institutions and clinical practitioners find the insights we share about the development process useful in informing their own model development efforts and to increase the likelihood of successful deployment and integration of AI in healthcare.
