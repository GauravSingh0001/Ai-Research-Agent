Machine learning and data analysis techniques interpret the reasons for car accidents and propose solutions to minimize them. However, this needs to take the benefits of big data solutions as the size and velocity of traffic accident data are increasingly large and rapid. This paper explores road car accident data patterns and proposes a predictive model by investigating meaningful data features, such as accident severity, the number of casualties, and the number of vehicles. The findings are discussed through a data-driven approach to understand the factors influencing road car accidents and highlight the key ones to propose accident prevention solutions.
