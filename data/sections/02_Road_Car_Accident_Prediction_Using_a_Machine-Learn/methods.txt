Therefore, a pre-processing model is designed to convert raw data using missing and meaningless feature removal, data attribute generalization, and outlier removal using interquartile. Four classification methods, including decision trees, random forest, multinomial logistic regression, and naïve Bayes, are used and evaluated to study the performance of road accident prediction.
