• We discuss a wide array of candidates for particle dark matter, but focus on neutralinos in models of supersymmetry and Kaluza-Klein dark matter in models of universal extra dimensions.

• We devote much of our attention to direct and indirect detection techniques, the constraints placed by these experiments and the reach of future experimental efforts.
