# Results Synthesis

## Key Findings by Paper

### Paper 1: Controlling aeroplane crashing through aviation infrastructure using multi-agent technology
- No specific quantitative findings identified in abstract.

### Paper 2: Spatially continuous snow depth mapping by aeroplane photogrammetry for annual peak of winter from 2017 to 2021 in open areas
- Despite
challenging acquisition conditions during the recording of the UltraCam
images (clouds, shaded areas and fresh snow), 99 % of unforested areas
were successfully photogrammetrically reconstructed.
- An extensive accuracy assessment was carried out
using check points, the comparison to DSMs derived from unpiloted aerial
systems and the comparison of snow-free DSM pixels to the ALS DTM.

### Paper 3: A new study for Aeroplane Wing shapes made of Boron Nitride nanotubes-reinforced Aluminium, Part I: Review, Dynamical Analyses and Simulation
- No specific quantitative findings identified in abstract.
